# Exercise-3: Calling built-in functions

# Create a variable `my.name` that contains your name

  my.name <- "Dustin Langner"

# Create a variable `name.length` that holds how many letters are in your name (use the `nchars()` function)

  name.length <- nchar("Dustin Langner")

# Print the number of letters in your name
  
  print(name.length)

# Create a variable `now.doing` that is your named followed by "is programming!" to the end of your name
# (use the `paste()` function)
  
  now.doing <- paste(my.name, " is programming")

# Make the `now.doing` variable upper case

  now.doing.uppercase <- toupper(now.doing)

### Bonus

# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to `fav.1` and `fav.2`

  fav.1 <- 1
  fav.2 <- 23

# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save it as the same variable
  
  fav.1 <- fav.1/sqrt(201)
  fav.2 <- fav.2/sqrt(201)


# Create a variable `raw.sum` that is the sum of those two variables. Use the `sum()` function for practice

  raw.sum <- fav.1 + fav.2

# Create a variable `round.sum` that is the `raw.sum` rounded to 1 decimal place. Use the `round()` function

  round.sum <- round(raw.sum, 1)
  
# Create two new variables `round.1` and `round.2` that are your `fav.1` and `fav.2` variables rounded
# to 1 decimal place

  round.1 <- round(fav.1, 1)
  round.2 <- round(fav.2, 1)


# Create a variable `sum.round` that is the sum of the rounded values
  
  sum.round <- round.1 + round.2


# Which is bigger, `round.sum` or `sum.round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)
  
  biggest.value <- max(round.sum, sum.round)
