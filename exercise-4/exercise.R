# Create a variable `lyric` that contains the text "I like to eat apples and bananas"

# Use `?substr` to see more about this function
# Store the result in a variable called `intro`
  
  intro <- substr(lyric, 1, 13)

# Hint: use `nchar()` to determine how many letters there are!
# Store the result in a variable called `fruits`
  
    fruits <- substr(lyric, 15, nchar(lyric))
    
# Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "ee".
